# Smartwatch & Agriculture App Design Guidelines

## Design Approach: Utility-Focused Wearable System

**Selected Approach:** Custom minimal design system optimized for wearable interfaces and agricultural workflows. Inspired by Material Design's clarity principles with adaptations for low-literacy, outdoor visibility, and quick-action requirements.

**Justification:** Agriculture-focused wearables prioritize functionality, outdoor readability, and speed over aesthetic differentiation. Farmers need instant access to critical information in varying light conditions with minimal interaction complexity.
